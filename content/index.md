JavaScript is amongst the world’s most popular and most used languages. It is a popular choice for web development and is supported by powerful libraries and frameworks such as React, Angular, Vue.js, Next.js and many more. The committee responsible for maintaining and standardizing the JavaScript programming language is Technical Committee 39 (TC39) of the ECMA International. There are 6 TC39 meetings each year in which proposals are made to implement new functionality with the goal foster the evolution of JavaScript, of which University of Bergen was the host of the international TC39 meeting in 2023. In order for a proposal to be implemented into JavaScript, it goes through a rigourous 6 stage process (https://tc39.es/process-document/). Each proposal has one or more author and champion who are responsible for developing and maintaining the proposal.

The goal of this project is in two parts:
Part 1: Map, analyse, and present how the proposals within TC39 affect the JavaScript language and each other. To date there has not been a consise overview of the ongoing and completed proposals within TC39. Information on proposals are available on the TC39 Github (https://github.com/tc39/proposals) but it is not easily accessible and digestible. This data will be presented on a website that will be easily accessible to the members of TC39. 

Part 2: Map and analyse the speed in which proposals are made and implemented. This has implications for the user because new functionalities take time to be adopted by the user. A quick succession of new functionalities could be detramental to the user experience especially if it affects or changes already implemented functionalities.
