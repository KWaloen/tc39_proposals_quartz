# Proposal Description:
## This proposal has been merged into the [class fields](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-class-fields) proposal.

Please see that repository for current status. The rest of this repository is left up as a historical archive. The old readme is available [here](OLD_README.md), but will not be kept up to date. Similarly, while the FAQ in this repository will continue to exist as is, it will not be updated; its canonical location incluing any updates is in the [class fields repository](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-class-fields/blob/HEAD/PRIVATE_SYNTAX_FAQ.md).
